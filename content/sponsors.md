## Sponsor Opportunities
Bioconductor is a non-profit organization that supports one of the most widely used data analysis tools in genomics. Bioconductor packages were downloaded by [over 1 million distinct IPs](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/index.html) in 2022. Software packages are contributed by more than 1,200 community developers worldwide.  

Our annual conference will bring together Bioconductor developers and users from academia, industry, and government to network and discuss the latest development in computational biology. The conference is unique in that in addition to talks and poster session, the meeting features 20+ workshops which provide hands-on learning about Bioconductor packages. All conference materials (videos, slides, talks, posters, workshops) are published online such that the conference provides a rich resource for learning Bioconductor.
