abstract: "In December 2022, the Bioconductor community began offering internships through Outreachy (outreachy.org), an organization that works with open source and open science communities to provide internships to individuals impacted by systemtic bias and underrepresentation in technology. In this session, Bioconductor's interns from the December 2022 - May 2023 cohort will share their work and experiences. Prospective mentors within the Bioconductor community who are interested in participating in Outreachy can also learn how to submit open source projects.
