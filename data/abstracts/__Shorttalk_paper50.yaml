abstract: "Advancements in sequencing technologies and the development of new data collection methods produce large volumes of biological data. However,  the computational infrastructure and skills currently required to leverage the vast quantities of big biological data render such analyses infeasible for basic, translational, and clinical researchers. We developed the software package, AnVILWorkflow, which provides an R-user-friendly working environment to utilize Cloud-implemented workflows. This package allows users to run sophisticated bioinformatics workflows without installing any dependencies or writing any script, while leveraging flexible and scalable cloud resources without maintaining or configuring them. We demonstrate the use cases of this package on two widely used and computationally demanding workflows - bulk RNA sequencing analysis and whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing data analysis. This package is included in Bioconductor 3.17 release."
