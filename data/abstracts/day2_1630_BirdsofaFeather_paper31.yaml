abstract: "Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project that promotes the generation, access and dissemination of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data while also allowing the integration of other valuable biological information in the studies. In that way, Bioconductor aims to facilitate the production of reproducible scientific results through high-quality documentation and to enable interdisciplinary and collaborative research. Hence, this project has made it possible to use, develop and manage bioinformatic tools and data, creating a big and organized community of researchers and software-developers that help each other and promote values such as diversity and inclusivity, a welcoming environment and community contributions.  However, the impact of Bioconductor is not the same across the world. In countries like Mexico and other Latin American countries in which bioinformatics has only been gaining relevance until recently, the diffusion and usage of Bioconductor resources are limited. There are of course multiple projects and excellent initiatives like RLadies (https://twitter.com/RLadiesCuerna for example) or CDSB (https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) organized by the scientific and bioinformatic community of these countries that intend to teach and disseminate knowledge about tools such as R and Bioconductor. But these are not enough to bridge the gap, and in many cases these projects face significant challenges, such as:   - limited accessibility to local instructors with active roles in the Bioconductor community, - limited funding for courses, meetings and other projects, - reduced or even non-existent promotion to Bioconductor resources and events   just to mention some. Although the root of these challenges involves particular economic and social contexts in each country that affect every aspect of human life, including unavoidably, the scientific field, we would like to open the conversation within the Bioconductor community to discuss particular points that can help minimize the gap between American/European/Australian community of Bioconductor and the rest of the world. Some of the issues we would like to attend are the current challenges implicated, what is missing and needed to overcome them, and what we, as students and junior scientists, can do to surpass some of these limitations, highlighting the relevance of this project and the scientific improvements its implementation would yield in countries such as ours (Mexico).  We – the presenters, are two young female scientists. Daianna is going to graduate in 2024 and Renee did in 2022. We have had the opportunity to study in a community where the promotion of general bioinformatic knowledge is important. Yet at the same time we are deeply aware that the opportunities we’ve had are rare and a huge privilege in our country and many others. We would like to do our part to bridge the gap, starting by bringing up the subject in spaces like the BioC conference."
