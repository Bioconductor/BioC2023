abstract: "Since the inception of Bioconductor, there has been a massive shift in the number and type of available cloud-based resources, giving the developer and user communities access to scalable compute and storage capacities without the need for maintaining their own infrastructure. Moreover, the rapid adoption of cloud technologies in the open source world has generated a suite of cloud-based development and automation tools.  In an effort to ensure that the Bioconductor ecosystem takes full advantage of these resources, we have formed the Bioconductor Cloud Methods Working Group, which hopes to provide a space for Bioconductor developers to present and collaborate on any cloud-adjacent project. Additionally, this working group will allow the community of users and developers alike to interact with each other as well as with the Bioconductor Core team, voicing their needs and providing feedback on current Bioconductor cloud offerings. At the moment, this group is focusing on 1) deployable containers, in the form of easing the use of Docker containers and the Kubernetes Helm Chart, 2) cloud storage and compute, in the form of developing and maintaining services offered by Bioconductor such as the workshop Galaxy instance, 3) GitHub actions, in an attempt to merge existing efforts and standardize a workflow for Bioconductor developers, and 4) cloud technology standards for Bioconductor. We invite the community to join the Bioconductor Cloud Methods Working Group to discuss our current focus, new ideas and projects, and collaborations."
