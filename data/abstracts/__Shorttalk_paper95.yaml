abstract: "Bioconductor has been around for over 20 years and has a lot of older Sweave vignettes that enable embedding R within Latex. However, Sweave is hard to maintain and compiles to PDF. The Sweave2Rmd project is an open source project for converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown, which are rendered as HTML files and easier to maintain. Bioconductor currently has 904 sweave vignettes that must be converted and replaced with R markdown files. I will be sharing about the benefits of converting Sweave vignettes to R markdown and how open source contributors can get involved with the Sweave2Rmd project. I will also share how package maintainers can support the Sweave2Rmd project."
