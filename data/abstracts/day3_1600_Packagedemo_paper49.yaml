abstract: "The recent emergence of multi-sample multi-condition single-cell multi-cohort studies allows researchers to investigate different cell states. The effective integration of multiple large-cohort studies promises biological insights into cells under different conditions that individual studies cannot provide. Here, we present scMerge2, a scalable algorithm that allows data integration of atlas-scale multi-sample multi-condition single-cell studies. We have generalized scMerge2 to enable the merging of millions of cells from single-cell studies generated by various single-cell technologies. Using a large COVID-19 data collection with over five million cells from 1000+ individuals, we demonstrate that scMerge2 enables multi-sample multi-condition scRNA-seq data integration from multiple cohorts and reveals signatures derived from cell-type expression that are more accurate in discriminating disease progression. Further, we demonstrate that scMerge2 can remove dataset variability in CyTOF, imaging mass cytometry and CITE-seq experiments, demonstrating its applicability to a broad spectrum of single-cell profiling technologies. scMerge2 is available in the Bioconductor package scMerge http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scMerge.html."
