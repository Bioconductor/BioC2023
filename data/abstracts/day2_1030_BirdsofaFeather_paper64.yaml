abstract: "Bioconductor became a [member of The Carpentries in August 2022](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2022-07-12-carpentries-membership/). As a member organization, Bioconductor is allocated a number of seats for the Carpentries instructor training program. So far, [18 community members](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-02-24-carpentries-update/) have been selected to attend the instructor training. These instructor trainees are working with the Bioconductor teaching committee to develop and teach the three sets of Bioconductor Carpentries training materials: 1) Introduction to data analysis with R and Bioconductor, 2) The Bioconductor project and 3) RNA-seq analysis with Bioconductor. On behalf of the [Bioconductor Community Advisory Board[(https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/) and [Bioconductor Teaching Committee](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/education-training/), we will host a birds of a feather session to give an update on this program and discuss future plans."
