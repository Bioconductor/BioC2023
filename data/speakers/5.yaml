text: "Jeffrey Moffitt is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Microbiology at Harvard Medical School and the Program in Cellular Molecular Medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital. His research focuses on the development of spatially resolved transcriptomic tools and their application to questions at the microbe-host interface in mammals. Jeff co-developed multiplexed-error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a transcriptome-scale single-RNA-molecule imaging technique capable of imaging and identifying thousands of RNA molecules within single cells in intact tissue samples. He demonstrated that this new measurement capability can define gene regulatory networks, map the intracellular organization of the transcriptome, and define and map cell types within tissues such as the brain. Jeff continues to develop new extensions of MERFISH and to apply these techniques to understand the spatial organization of commensal microbial communities, the role this organization plays on microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, and the role of the cellular organization of host tissues in the response to microbial perturbations. Jeff was named a Pew Biomedical Research Scholar in 2019. https://moffittlab.github.io/"
